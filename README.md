Algorithms:
============
**Peak finding**:
	
	Proof that every exists has a proof + asymptotic complexity analysis of both 1D algorithms
	Asymptotic complexity analysis of both 2D algorithms
	1D Greedy Algorithm

	2D Greedy Algorithm
	2D Recursive Algorithm
	2D Recursive Splitting Algorithm

**Document Distance**:

	8 different algorithms implemented to show the differences in performance
Please refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/HugoSTorres/Barry_CS-331/wiki/Document-Distance-Problem) for the explanation of the problem.

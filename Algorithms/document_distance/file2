Python: read file line by line into array
up vote 160 down vote favorite

How do I read every line of a file in Python and store each line as an element in an array?

I want to read the file line by line and each line is appended to the end of the array. I could not find how to do this anywhere and I couldn't find how to create an array of strings in Python.

Here's a real-world example that shows how to read/write a file: dreamsyssoft.com/python-scripting-tutorial/classes-tutorial.php –  Triton Man Aug 8 at 19:01

with open(fname) as f:
    content = f.readlines()

I'm guessing that you meant list and not array.

In this case, which array contains the lines? –  Anderson Green May 19 at 18:04

Content is the list that contains the read lines. –  Sammy May 22 at 9:02

How can we strip() the lines using this method? Because the elements have "\n" at the end. –  AliBZ Aug 26 at 18:33

See Input and Ouput:

f = open('filename')
lines = f.readlines()
f.close()

or with stripping the newline character:

lines = [line.strip() for line in open('filename')]

if you only want to discard the newline: lines = (line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(filename)) –  Janus Troelsen Oct 11 '12 at 10:14
	 
	
Thank you, the example with the stripped newline character is excellent! –  dotancohen May 20 at 18:06
	 
	
For a list it should be lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(filename)] –  Lazik 49 mins ago

This is more explicit than necessary, but does what you want.

ins = open( "file.txt", "r" )
array = []
for line in ins:
    array.append( line )

You want to be sure to call ins.close() if you use this method –  aaronasterling Jul 19 '10 at 0:09
	 
	
@aaronasterling what happens when you don't call ins.close()? –  wrongusername Nov 27 '11 at 0:35

@wrongusername the file stays open and consumes resources. It won't be automatically garbage collected until ins goes out of scope. –  aaronasterling Nov 30 '11 at 20:40

This will yield an "array" of lines from the file.

lines = tuple(open(filename, 'r'))

Another option is numpy.genfromtxt, e.g:

import numpy as np
data = np.genfromtxt("yourfile.dat",delimiter="\n")

This will make data a numpy array with as many rows as are in your file
